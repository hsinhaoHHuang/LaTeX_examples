    \maketitle

    \begin{abstract}
        This is a simple paragraph at the beginning of the
        document. A brief introduction about the main subject.
    \end{abstract}


    After our abstract we can begin the first paragraph, then press ``enter'' twice to start the second one.

    This line will start a second paragraph.

    I will start the third paragraph and then add \\ a manual line break which causes
    this text to start on a new line but remains part of the same paragraph.
    Alternatively, I can use the \verb|\newline|\newline command to start a new line,
    which is also part of the same paragraph.

    First document. This is a simple example, with no
    extra parameters or packages included.

    Some of the \textbf{greatest}                          % bold text in LaTeX is typeset using the \textbf{...} command.
    discoveries in \underline{science}                     % italicised text is produced using the \textit{...} command.
    were made by \textbf{\textit{accident}}.               %  to underline text use the \underline{...} command.

    Some of the greatest \emph{discoveries} in science
    were made by accident.

    \textit{Some of the greatest \emph{discoveries}        % Inside normal text, the emphasized text is italicized, but this behaviour is reversed if used inside an italicized text

    \begin{figure}[h]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{fig_test}   % set the figureâ€™s width to 75% of the text width
        \caption
        {
            A nice plot.
        }
        \label{fig:test}
    \end{figure}

    As you can see in figure \ref{fig:test},
    the function grows near the origin.
    This example is on page \pageref{fig:test}.

    \begin{itemize}                                        % unordered list
        \item The individual entries are indicated with
              a black dot, a so-called bullet.
        \item The text in the entries may be of any length.
    \end{itemize}

    \begin{enumerate}                                      % ordered list
        \item This is the first entry in our list.
        \item The list numbers increase with each entry we add.
    \end{enumerate}

    \begin{math}                                           % inline equation
        E=mc^2
    \end{math} is typeset in a paragraph using inline math mode---as is $E=mc^2$, and so too is \(E=mc^2\).

    The mass-energy equivalence is described by the famous equation
    \[ E=mc^2 \] discovered in 1905 by Albert Einstein.

    In natural units ($c = 1$), the formula expresses the identity
    \begin{equation}
        E=m
    \end{equation}

    Subscripts in math mode are written as $a_b$ and superscripts are written as $a^b$. These can be combined and nested to write expressions such as

    \[ T^{i_1 i_2 \dots i_p}_{j_1 j_2 \dots j_q} = T(x^{i_1},\dots,x^{i_p},e_{j_1},\dots,e_{j_q}) \]

    We write integrals using $\int$ and fractions using $\frac{a}{b}$. Limits are placed on integrals using superscripts and subscripts:

    \[ \int_0^1 \frac{dx}{e^x} =  \frac{e-1}{e} \]

    Lower case Greek letters are written as $\omega$ $\delta$ etc. while upper case Greek letters are written as $\Omega$ $\Delta$.

    Mathematical operators are prefixed with a backslash as $\sin(\beta)$, $\cos(\alpha)$, $\log(x)$ etc.
